Code to run the evidence calculation with the harmonic package. 

For some posteriors with some multimodality, it is advised to install the multimodal branch of the harmonic Github repo: https://github.com/astro-informatics/harmonic/tree/multimodal_base

The script for running the calculation is `run_harmoni_evidence.py`. An example HTCondor job submission script is provided, along with a test run for the PBAG run of GRB170817A.
